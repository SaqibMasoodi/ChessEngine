## **Finally cooked up the UI (and added some functions to the engine)**

### **The Engine**

* **Cleaner Code:** Refactored `GameState` and `Move` classes with better naming and docstrings (actually readable now).
* **Better Logic:** Hardened the rules for castling, en-passant, and move validation.
* **New Features:** Added `scoreBoard()` and full support for pawn promotion choices.

### **The UI & UX**

* **Modern Look:** Total rewrite of the main interface with a new color palette and scaled assets.
* **Control Bar:** Added a tactile sidebar for Undo, Redo, Reset, and Sound toggles.
* **Media:** Integrated audio (with safe fallbacks) and a new media sidebar.
* **Smooth Handling:** Improved event loops and added a dedicated hook for pawn promotion.

### **Cleanup & Docs**

* **Assets:** Added fresh images, sound files, and a `CREDITS.md`.
* **Housekeeping:** Updated the README, expanded the engine docs, and purged obsolete test files.
